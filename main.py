# ideas:
# include name of sensor when printing data piece
# ask user if they would like avg of specific data values for all sensors in Walnut Creek
# ex: avg of humidity values for all sensors/monitors in walnut creek
#
# ask user if they would like to see other types of data from the same sensor
#
#
# other project ideas:
# riddle solver? pull random riddles from the web with single word answers and ask the user to solve them
